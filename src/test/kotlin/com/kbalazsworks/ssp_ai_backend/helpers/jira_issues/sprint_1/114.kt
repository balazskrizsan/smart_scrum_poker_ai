Summary: Ticket detail modal fails to render markdown formatting
Description: The ticket detail modal does not correctly render Jira-style markdown formatting such as bullet points, numbered lists, bold or italic text. Instead, raw syntax like *bold*, - list item, or {code} is displayed literally in the UI. This occurs on both the ticket preview and full modal views, indicating that the markdown renderer is either missing or misconfigured. The bug was introduced after a recent refactor where the rendering component was swapped out for performance reasons. As a result, descriptions and comments look cluttered and unreadable, especially for longer tickets. Users can no longer rely on formatting to structure their content, leading to confusion and lower productivity. This also affects accessibility, since unstructured blobs of text are harder to parse visually. We need to reintroduce markdown parsing, possibly using a lightweight library that supports Jira-style syntax or extend an existing parser to include custom tokens.
