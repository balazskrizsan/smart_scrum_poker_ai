Summary: Monitoring alerts not firing due to misconfigured Prometheus alert rules
Description: Critical system alerts for high memory usage and API error rates are not triggering as expected, even when the Prometheus dashboard clearly shows threshold breaches. After investigation, it turns out the alerting rules were recently modified and now contain incorrect label selectors that prevent the expressions from matching actual data points. Additionally, the evaluation interval for some rules was inadvertently changed from 1 minute to 15 minutes, reducing alert granularity. These misconfigurations make it impossible to detect and react to real-time production issues, putting service availability at risk. The broken rules were not caught during CI validation since they syntactically passed, but lacked proper test coverage. We need to enforce stricter linting and introduce integration tests for all Prometheus rules before deployment. A manual audit of all current alerting rules should be conducted to verify their correctness. AlertManager also needs to be reviewed to ensure it routes notifications based on updated severity labels. Proper end-to-end testing and a rollback mechanism for rule changes should be added to the deployment pipeline.
