Summary: Real-time votes not reflected in story card until full page reload
Description: During planning poker sessions, when team members cast their votes, the story card UI does not update in real-time for all connected clients. Even though the backend correctly receives and broadcasts vote updates via WebSocket, the frontend sometimes fails to render the new votes until the user refreshes the page. This seems to be caused by the vote update events not being properly handled by the Redux/WebSocket bridge. In some cases, the payload is received but discarded due to mismatched storyId or unexpected message structure. As a result, participants see outdated vote counts or think their input was not registered. This breaks trust in the planning process and causes duplicate submissions or confusion. The vote component should be listening to the correct event channel and update its local state immediately on vote change. A full regression test is needed to ensure event propagation and state updates work across reconnects and simultaneous sessions.
