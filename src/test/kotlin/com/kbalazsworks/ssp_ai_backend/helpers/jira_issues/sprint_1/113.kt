Summary: Sprint filtering ignores tickets without story points
Description: The backend filtering logic for sprint-level metrics skips tickets that do not have assigned story points, assuming they are irrelevant. However, in many teams, unestimated tickets are deliberately included in sprints and should be tracked. Because these tickets are ignored, metrics like ticket count, throughput, and issue type distribution are skewed. This particularly affects reporting on sprint completion rates and affects teams practicing continuous estimation. The logic currently uses a WHERE story_points IS NOT NULL clause that should be removed or replaced with an optional flag. Users are unaware of the filtering, leading to incorrect assumptions in dashboards and planning tools. Furthermore, embedding-based features trained on full sprint data also end up missing a subset of tickets, introducing subtle bias. A code audit is needed to locate all the filters that exclude these tickets and ensure consistent behavior across all endpoints.
