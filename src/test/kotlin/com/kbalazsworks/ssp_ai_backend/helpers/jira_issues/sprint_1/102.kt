Summary: PGVector similarity search returns incorrect results with 3072-dim embeddings
Description: The semantic search feature yields irrelevant results when using the 3072-dimensional embeddings stored in the jira_ticket_embeddings table. Upon inspection, the cosine similarity calculation appears to be applied on incorrectly normalized vectors. The issue does not exist with the 1536-dim variant, suggesting that the bug is specific to the extended dimensionality handling. A likely cause is a faulty type coercion or array misalignment when inserting or retrieving data from PostgreSQL. Queries return vectors that are clearly not semantically related, yet score higher than genuinely similar tickets. This undermines user trust in the system and makes internal QA impossible. Vector validation tests are missing, and malformed data could be silently corrupting the search index. This issue may also propagate to sprint-level AI summaries or history-based recommendations. We need to verify the integrity of the embeddings and inspect all transformation steps between model output and database storage.

- Sarah Bennett at 2024-08-1T9:00:00.000+0000: Could this be due to a shape mismatch or partial truncation during insert? Are we sure that all 3072 elements are preserved and in the right order when writing the embeddings to the jira_ticket_embeddings table?
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-1T10:00:00.000+0000: We double-checked the insert path — the 3072-element float array is passed from the embedding service as a JSON array, then mapped to pgvector(3072) using JOOQ. However, during deserialization, we noticed that in some cases, the vector is coerced into a smaller float array if the input contains unexpected whitespace or trailing commas. That doesn't happen with the 1536-dim variant, which is strictly validated. We may need to introduce explicit vector shape validation before insert.
- John Carter at 2024-08-1T11:00:00.000+0000: Let’s add a database constraint or application-level assertion that rejects any embedding with a dimension count not equal to 3072. We should also backfill a checksum audit to find corrupted rows and confirm if they’re the ones producing bad results. Once that’s done, we can retrain or re-embed affected records and verify similarity scoring against a trusted test set.
