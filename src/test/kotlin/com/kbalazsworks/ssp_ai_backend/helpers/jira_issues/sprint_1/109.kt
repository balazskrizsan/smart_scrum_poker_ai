Summary: Deployment rollback fails due to persistent volume claims not being detached
Description: Rolling back failed deployments on our Kubernetes cluster sometimes fails due to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) remaining attached to the terminated pods. This causes subsequent pods to get stuck in a Pending or CrashLoopBackOff state because they cannot acquire the required volume. The issue occurs mostly with workloads using ReadWriteOnce PVCs and StatefulSets during quick redeploys or high-load situations. Our current Helm rollback strategy does not wait for volume detachment before reapplying previous manifests, leading to race conditions. There are no clear cleanup hooks in place, and volume retention policies are inconsistently applied across namespaces. As a result, failed releases block further recovery attempts, requiring manual pod deletion or PVC force-detach. We need to revisit our storage class settings, implement pre-stop hooks, and ensure our rollback automation handles volume lifecycle correctly. Logging and monitoring should be improved to surface these issues earlier, and retention policies should be unified to avoid orphaned claims.
