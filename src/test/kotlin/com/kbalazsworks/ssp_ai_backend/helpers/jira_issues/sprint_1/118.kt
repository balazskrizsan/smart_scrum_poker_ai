Root cause analysis shows that the phase transition event is emitted only to a subset of WebSocket sessions, often depending on which nodes in the cluster the users are connected to. Our current WebSocket broadcasting implementation uses in-memory publish-subscribe mechanisms without cross-node awareness, which breaks in horizontally scaled environments. Additionally, there is no retry or confirmation logic ensuring that all clients received the transition update, and missed events cause desynchronization. Because of this, the backend may silently reject late votes without the client being aware, resulting in user frustration and lost inputs. A robust server-side session manager is needed to track the exact state of each session centrally and rebroadcast critical phase changes through a distributed messaging layer such as Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka. Clients should receive periodic sync messages containing the current canonical state, including voting status and remaining time, to recover from any missed messages. We also need to implement audit logging for state transitions and rejected votes to assist with debugging and QA verification. Until this is resolved, the voting experience will remain unreliable in multi-node deployments and during network instability scenarios.",

Summary: Server-side voting session lifecycle fails to propagate phase updates consistently
Description: The backend logic managing the planning poker voting session does not consistently propagate phase transitions—such as moving from "voting" to "closed"—to all connected clients via WebSocket. This results in situations where some clients still think voting is open and attempt to submit story points, while others have already transitioned to the results view. Root cause analysis shows that the phase transition event is emitted only to a subset of WebSocket sessions, often depending on which nodes in the cluster the users are connected to. Our current WebSocket broadcasting implementation uses in-memory publish-subscribe mechanisms without cross-node awareness, which breaks in horizontally scaled environments. Additionally, there is no retry or confirmation logic ensuring that all clients received the transition update, and missed events cause desynchronization. Because of this, the backend may silently reject late votes without the client being aware, resulting in user frustration and lost inputs. A robust server-side session manager is needed to track the exact state of each session centrally and rebroadcast critical phase changes through a distributed messaging layer such as Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka. Clients should receive periodic sync messages containing the current canonical state, including voting status and remaining time, to recover from any missed messages. We also need to implement audit logging for state transitions and rejected votes to assist with debugging and QA verification. Until this is resolved, the voting experience will remain unreliable in multi-node deployments and during network instability scenarios.

- Sarah Bennett at 2024-08-3T10:00:00.000+0000: Redis Pub/Sub would already be a big step up and is lightweight enough for our use case. Kafka would give ordering guarantees but adds more ops overhead. I’d recommend starting with Redis.
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-5T11:00:00.000+0000: Also, should we add a periodic sync message from server to client with the canonical session state? That way if a client misses an event, it can recover on the next sync.
