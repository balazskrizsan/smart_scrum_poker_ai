Summary: Sprint start dates are incorrectly parsed in time zones with DST
Description: Sprints created through the Jira integration API have incorrect start and end dates when the board is configured in a timezone that observes Daylight Saving Time. For example, in Europe/Budapest, a sprint set to start at 09:00 on a Monday appears as 08:00 in our database. The issue stems from the backend incorrectly parsing the ISO 8601 timestamp without accounting for DST shifts. This causes mismatches between the times shown in Jira and those used in our analytics backend. As a result, sprint duration calculations and overlap detection logic are off by one hour in affected regions. This causes misalignment in planning tools, report generation, and notification scheduling. The problem affects all boards using DST-aware zones and causes cumulative data skew over multiple sprints. A thorough audit of our datetime parsing and conversion logic is required, especially around Z-suffix usage and OffsetDateTime conversions.

Comments:
- Emily Watson at 2024-08-8T9:00:00.000+0000: Have we confirmed whether the issue occurs only during the DST transition periods, or does it affect all sprint start dates year-round in affected time zones?
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-8T10:00:00.000+0000: The bug is consistent year-round for DST-aware time zones — the backend uses a fixed offset parser (Z suffix) instead of respecting local time zone rules. So even outside the transition dates, any time expressed as "local time" gets shifted incorrectly when interpreted as UTC.
- John Carter at 2024-08-8T11:00:00.000+0000: Are we using OffsetDateTime or ZonedDateTime in our parsing logic? If it's the former, that would explain why DST is ignored completely.
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-8T13:00:00.000+0000: Exactly — we currently deserialize all incoming timestamps as OffsetDateTime, which locks in the numeric offset (e.g. +01:00) but discards timezone information like Europe/Budapest. We’ll need to migrate the parsing layer to use ZonedDateTime and retain the full region-based time zone so DST rules are correctly applied. A patch is in progress for the Jira integration module.
