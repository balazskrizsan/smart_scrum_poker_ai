This seems to happen more frequently when more than 5 users are connected and interacting simultaneously. Logs indicate a sudden termination of the session with no corresponding error or timeout. This leads to clients having to reconnect manually, and in some cases, messages are lost entirely. No reconnection attempts are triggered automatically. The issue has been observed on both local and staging environments, and is not limited to specific browsers or frontend versions. We've verified that the WebSocket configuration on the server side does not include any specific idle timeout or connection limit. CPU and memory usage during the incident are within acceptable levels. A deeper inspection of the message handler lifecycle and threading model may be necessary. We suspect a race condition or resource contention could be the root cause.",

Summary: WebSocket connection drops intermittently during story point estimation
Description: During active sprint planning sessions, the backend WebSocket server occasionally drops connections without any clear pattern. This seems to happen more frequently when more than 5 users are connected and interacting simultaneously. Logs indicate a sudden termination of the session with no corresponding error or timeout. This leads to clients having to reconnect manually, and in some cases, messages are lost entirely. No reconnection attempts are triggered automatically. The issue has been observed on both local and staging environments, and is not limited to specific browsers or frontend versions. We've verified that the WebSocket configuration on the server side does not include any specific idle timeout or connection limit. CPU and memory usage during the incident are within acceptable levels. A deeper inspection of the message handler lifecycle and threading model may be necessary. We suspect a race condition or resource contention could be the root cause.

Comments:
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-1T8:00:00.000+0000: Have we ruled out frontend heartbeat or ping messages being dropped? Some WebSocket implementations close connections silently if no keepalive is detected for a while, even if the server itself doesn't set an idle timeout.
- John Carter at 2024-08-1T9:00:00.000+0000: Good question — yes, we verified that the frontend sends a ping frame every 20 seconds, and packet captures confirm they’re reaching the server. The drops still happen even when those pings are flowing regularly.
- James Turner at 2024-08-1T9:00:00.000+0000: Could this be related to connection limits or socket exhaustion at the OS level? ulimit or ephemeral port exhaustion can cause abrupt terminations without clear logging if too many sockets are opened quickly.
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-1T10:00:00.000+0000: I checked that — the ulimit -n is set to 65535 on the staging box and netstat doesn't show anything close to exhaustion. Also, when the drop happens, the number of open WebSocket sessions is well under 50. So probably not a system-level limit.
- John Carter at 2024-08-1T11:00:00.000+0000: Then we should capture a thread dump right after a drop event and inspect whether any message handlers or WebSocket lifecycle methods are blocked or deadlocked. If we’re dealing with a race in the dispatcher or message queue, that would explain the silence in the logs and the inconsistent reproduction.
