Summary: Infrastructure drift detected between Terraform state and live AWS environment
Description: Our weekly drift detection run has flagged multiple inconsistencies between the Terraform state and the actual AWS infrastructure. Several S3 buckets, IAM policies, and RDS instance parameters differ from what’s declared in code. This drift likely comes from manual changes introduced through the AWS Console or ad-hoc CLI scripts that bypassed infrastructure as code. The most critical discrepancy involves an IAM policy that is broader in production than declared, posing a potential security risk. The affected resources are spread across two environments (staging and prod) and involve multiple contributors, making root cause analysis difficult. We need to audit recent manual changes and investigate why CI/CD pipelines did not prevent them. In the long term, we should enforce stricter policies around drift via automated rollback or alerts. Terraform state should be treated as the single source of truth, and manual overrides must be reviewed and reverted if unauthorized. Additional controls such as policy-as-code (OPA/Conftest) and Terraform Cloud drift alerts may be helpful.

- Emily Watson at 2024-08-6T9:00:00.000+0000: We’ve had several tickets from users in Hungary and Germany — reports show corrupted characters in downloaded PDFs.

- Olivia Parker at 2024-08-6T11:00:00.000+0000: Most likely the library defaults to a basic font without full UTF-8 coverage. We’ll need to embed an appropriate font manually.
