Summary: Story point selection UI becomes unresponsive after reconnection
Description: When a user reconnects to the planning session after a temporary network drop, the story point selection buttons remain visible but unresponsive. Clicking them produces no effect, and no WebSocket messages are sent to the backend. This seems to happen when the frontend's internal state is not reset properly after a WebSocket reconnection event. The Redux store (or equivalent state manager) still holds the stale connection state, causing the event handlers to be bound to a dead socket. Users are forced to refresh the entire browser tab to regain interactivity. This affects the user experience during critical planning moments and leads to inconsistent participation data. Logs show that reconnection happens at the transport level, but component-level lifecycle hooks are not retriggered. A full teardown and re-initialization of WebSocket bindings is likely missing. The reconnect event should reset all relevant UI state and rebroadcast any queued actions to avoid desync.

Comments:
- John Carter at 2024-08-10T9:00:00.000+0000: Does the issue reproduce reliably if we simulate a network drop using DevTools and then restore connection after a few seconds? Just want to confirm it's not race-condition dependent.
- Olivia Parker at 2024-08-10T10:00:00.000+0000: Yes, it’s 100% reproducible that way. The WebSocket reconnects at the transport layer, but the vote handler components don’t rebind. The button click still fires a Redux action, but the underlying socket reference is stale and silently fails.
- John Carter at 2024-08-10T11:00:00.000+0000: Do we currently handle socket reinitialization in a global handler or per-component effect? It sounds like the local UI doesn't get rehydrated when the socket comes back.
- Olivia Parker at 2024-08-10T13:00:00.000+0000: Right now, reconnection logic lives in a global hook, but components don’t subscribe to socket lifecycle events. We’ll need to emit a custom "reconnected" event from the global layer, then trigger a full teardown and rebind in each story interaction component. Also planning to queue any in-flight vote actions and replay them after rebind.
