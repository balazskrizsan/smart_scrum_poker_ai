Summary: Session timer desync causes voting to close prematurely for some users
Description: During planning poker sessions, users report that the voting interface closes unexpectedly while others are still selecting story points. The issue appears to stem from client-side session timers that drift out of sync with the server’s authoritative voting state. In some cases, clients start countdowns slightly earlier or later due to network latency or delayed WebSocket initialization, causing the vote submission window to close inconsistently across participants. As a result, users are either locked out before making a selection or their votes are silently rejected without warning. The server correctly enforces a central timeout, but the frontend displays a local timer that does not reflect this source of truth. Additionally, if the client tab is inactive or throttled by the browser, the timer may stop updating entirely. This bug undermines user trust in the fairness of the process and creates confusion during team discussions. A solution should involve syncing the remaining time periodically with the server, displaying live status updates over WebSocket, and disabling local countdown authority entirely. All vote-related actions should be gated behind the server’s current session phase, not inferred locally. The UI should also clearly indicate whether the vote window is open or closed based on server confirmation, not just elapsed time. A full review of the session timer logic and proper fallback handling is needed to prevent premature closure and allow consistent user experience across all participants.
