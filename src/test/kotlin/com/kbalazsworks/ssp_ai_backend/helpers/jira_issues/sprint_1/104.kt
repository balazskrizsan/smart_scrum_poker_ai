Summary: Implement offline-first support with optimistic UI for planning sessions
Description: To improve the resilience and usability of planning sessions in environments with poor or intermittent internet connectivity, we need to implement offline-first behavior across key components of the frontend application. This includes local caching of tickets, story point selections, user sessions, and voting results using browser storage mechanisms like IndexedDB or localStorage. When the client is offline, actions such as selecting story points or switching sprints should queue up locally and be replayed automatically once connectivity is restored. Additionally, an optimistic UI pattern should be introduced so that interactions feel immediate, even before server acknowledgment. This involves designing a layer that can temporarily assume success on user actions and revert or retry intelligently on failure. The implementation will require architectural changes, such as abstracting API and WebSocket calls through an action queue manager and adding network state detection hooks to all interactive components. We must also clearly surface the connection status to the user with appropriate toasts or banners, and provide a recovery strategy if desync is detected between client and server state. Special attention needs to be paid to potential merge conflicts when the same ticket is updated by multiple users offline. The project will require breaking down the work into multiple sub-tasks: connection monitoring, local caching, optimistic rendering, action queue management, and conflict resolution. Proper testing will also involve simulating network disruptions and verifying state reconciliation in complex scenarios. This feature is critical for distributed teams working in low-reliability environments and is expected to span at least two sprints including QA and regression coverage.
