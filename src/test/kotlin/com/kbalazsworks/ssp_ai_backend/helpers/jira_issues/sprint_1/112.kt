Summary: Invalid JSON stored in text field of ticket embeddings
Description: The text field of the jira_ticket_embeddings table, which should store valid JSON, occasionally contains malformed strings that break downstream processing. The corruption seems to happen intermittently when tickets are updated in rapid succession, possibly due to a race condition in the transformation logic. We've observed fields being truncated, nested structures being flattened incorrectly, and missing quotes around property names. This leads to deserialization failures during vector re-indexing and causes the related tickets to be excluded from semantic search. In worst cases, the entire sprint-level retrieval fails because of one corrupted entry. Our error logs do not catch these serialization issues early enough, and there is no schema validation at the DB level. We need to implement stricter input sanitation and introduce a test to ensure all stored text values conform to a defined JSON schema before insertion or update.
