Summary: CI pipeline fails intermittently due to Docker layer cache corruption
Description: Our main CI pipeline fails randomly on the Docker image build step with a no space left on device or failed to extract layer error. This seems to be caused by a corrupted or exhausted Docker layer cache on the GitHub Actions runners or self-hosted agents. Cleaning the cache manually resolves the issue temporarily, but it returns after a few runs. The problem is more frequent on builds that involve multiple stages and large base images, especially when switching between branches with different dependency trees. We currently rely on default caching behavior without explicitly managing space or purging old layers. This instability breaks the developer feedback loop and wastes significant CI credits. A more robust cache eviction strategy and regular cleanup job are required, along with limits on retained layers. We should also explore using remote Docker registries with cache mounts or prebuilt layers to reduce build variance.

- James Turner at 2024-08-10T9:00:00.000+0000: Has anyone checked if the cache corruption only happens on self-hosted runners, or is it also affecting the default GitHub-hosted runners? I'm wondering if our disk space limits differ.
- Dave Leard at 2024-08-10T10:00:00.000+0000: Good question — I ran a few test builds on both. It happens on both environments, but it’s more frequent on the self-hosted runners. Looks like they accumulate layers faster without automatic cleanup.
- James Turner at 2024-08-10T11:00:00.000+0000: Would switching to using buildx with remote cache storage (like AWS S3 or GCR) help here? That way we can avoid depending on the runner’s local disk space.
- Dave Leard at 2024-08-10T12:00:00.000+0000: Yes, using buildx with a remote cache is actually one of the recommended solutions for this. I can prototype that in a separate branch and compare build times and cache hit rates.
