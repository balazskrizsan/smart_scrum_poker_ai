Summary: Backend allows duplicate sprint names within the same board
Description: Our backend currently permits creating multiple sprints with identical names under the same Jira board, even though Jira enforces unique names per board. This leads to ambiguity in analytics queries and user-facing reports. Users have reported confusion when trying to generate burndown charts or fetch sprint-specific embeddings, as it's unclear which sprint instance is being referenced. The bug is caused by the missing unique constraint at the database level and lack of validation in the createSprint() service. Because our logic uses sprint names for lookup in several places, having duplicates breaks assumptions in filtering, aggregating, and displaying sprint data. This could also cause accidental overwrites during re-sync operations. Fixing this requires enforcing uniqueness both in the DB schema and in the application layer, with appropriate error messages returned to the frontend.
