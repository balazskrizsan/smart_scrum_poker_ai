Summary: Ticket embedding not updated when description changes in Jira
Description: Whenever a Jira ticket’s description is updated, the change is not reflected in the jira_ticket_embeddings table. Our backend is supposed to fetch the new text content and re-generate embeddings using OpenAI embeddings API, but this pipeline seems to be broken. No update call is triggered, and there are no logs indicating any webhook or polling logic being hit. We have verified that Jira webhooks are configured properly and fire on description updates. The issue may be on the backend’s webhook handler, which might be discarding or ignoring the event payload. As a result, semantic search across tickets returns outdated content, causing users to miss relevant results. This affects the accuracy of both single-ticket retrieval and sprint-level analysis. A short-term fix could involve manually triggering re-embedding via a script, but a permanent fix is needed in the webhook consumption flow.

Comments:
- Emily Watson at 2024-08-2T9:00:00.000+0000: Are we sure the Jira webhook actually includes the updated description in its payload? Maybe it’s firing, but the relevant field isn’t present or has a different path than expected.
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-2T10:00:00.000+0000: Yes, we inspected the raw payload — the issue.fields.description field is present and contains the updated text. So the data is there, the problem seems to be further downstream in our processing.
- James Turner at 2024-08-2T11:00:00.000+0000: Is the webhook handler even receiving the requests? Could something in the infrastructure (e.g. firewall, reverse proxy) be silently dropping or misrouting them?
- Michael Brooks at 2024-08-2T13:00:00.000+0000: We checked the logs of the service that handles webhooks, and there's no sign of incoming requests on PUT /jira/webhook. That endpoint works for other events like ticket creation, so it’s possible the descriptionUpdated event is being sent to a different route or not mapped correctly in our router.
- John Carter at 2024-08-2T14:00:00.000+0000: Let’s add a fallback catch-all route to log any unmatched webhook traffic and confirm we’re not discarding valid events due to misconfigured routes. We should also add temporary verbose logging for all webhook payloads to help with debugging.
- Sarah Bennett at 2024-08-2T15:00:00.000+0000: Once we confirm the webhook is flowing through correctly, we also need to verify that the embedding update queue is consuming and processing the update jobs. Even if the handler is fixed, outdated queue logic could prevent the actual re-embedding from happening. We might need to invalidate and requeue stale tickets as part of the fix.
